Ideas

Just do a script for a single stat, that way can focus more on that stat

try different models
Stat | Model Suggestion | Reason
Disposals | XGBoost or Negative Binomial | High variance, count but semi-continuous in behavior
Goals | Poisson or Negative Binomial | Often 0-3 goals, low mean, classic count data
Marks | Poisson or Negative Binomial | Integer count, similar to goals
Tackles | Poisson or Negative Binomial | Discrete, skewed
Kicks, Clearances | XGBoost or Poisson | Discrete but can be high values â€” hybrid zone
